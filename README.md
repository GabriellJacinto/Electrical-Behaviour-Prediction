# Scientific Initiation Project (PIC) - Eletrical Behaviour Prediction
Some data from my undergrad research assistant position, you can also find some jupyter notebooks here.

The objective of this work is to apply Machine Learning techniques to predict Electrical Behaviour of circuits instead of the traditional and time consuming procedure of exhaustive simulation.

## TO DO
