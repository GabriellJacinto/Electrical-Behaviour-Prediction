# CMOS Technology Circuits
This folder contains the circuits used in our work. For each circuit there is a "Data" folder and a "Models" folder.
As of now, we have used 32nm and 16nm technologies.

## Data
Contains the hspice simulation files, some python scripts for automation, the circuit description, and other extra files used for the development.

## Models
Contains the jupyter notebooks used for data processing and training of the Machine Learning algorithms. There can also be found compiled results from the trained models.
